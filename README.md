# Quote example

Small app that allows a user to view the details of an option quote.

Requires usage of: https://github.com/steven-solomon/quote_backend

Working toward building something more complex than a simple view.

TODO:
- trim input on search box 
- handle failed search
- Layout row using flex box
- Allow user to see the option chain for a symbol
- Persist a list of selected stocks that the user can add to from the quote view
